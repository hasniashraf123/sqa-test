I am having an exception when I tried to run the WebSocket. Here is the screenshot https://app.screencast.com/9eYytO53r0GnI

Following are the test cases for the testing of WebSocket: 

1. Verify that a connection can be successfully established to ws://localhost:3333/currency.
2. Validate that the connection fails gracefully if the WebSocket server is not running.
3. Ensure that the script receives updated cryptocurrency prices as WebSocket messages.
4. Check the correct parsing of the received data for cryptocurrency prices.
5. Verify that the script can handle receiving data at the expected interval (every 5 seconds).
6. Test the behavior when receiving malformed or unexpected data.
7. Check that the script can gracefully close the WebSocket connection.
8. Verify that the script handles unexpected connection closures from the server.
9. Test scenarios where the server forcefully closes the connection.
10. Validate the script's behavior when receiving invalid or malformed WebSocket frames.
11. Test error handling when encountering network issues or timeouts.
12. Evaluate the script's performance under normal load conditions.
